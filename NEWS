optparse 1.1.0
==============
* In ``make_option`` argument ``type="numeric"`` automatically cast to ``double``.
  Previously users might have received an error passing negative numbers if they
  accidentally specified "numeric" instead of "double".

optparse 1.0.2
==============
* Project website moved to https://github.com/trevorld/optparse
* We now replace all occurrences of %prog in usage message (including description and epilogue).
  Previously we would only replace one occurrence and didn't make replacements in description and epilogue.
* Fix bug in ``parse_args`` when we have options with no short flag and positional_arguments=TRUE.
  Thanks Miroslav Posta for bug report.

  to match more closely what the Python module does

* Now requires package getopt (>= 1.19) which has also been moved to 
  Imports field from Depends field in DESCRIPTION
